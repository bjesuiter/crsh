* TODO Think about how to do js shell logic outside of inline functions
How to interpolate env vars? Should it just be $HOME or should I do the more js-y ${HOME}?

The above is a good idea because you could also do e.g.:
touch file${new Date()}.js

touch $HOME/file.js

Here's how I think I can solve this, and also solve "source a file". Define a JS/unix hybrid. Something like this:
"Any statement that doesn't end in a semi colon should be executed as a unix command.
Any other statement should be eval'd in Deno."

And if I start a new scope, a newline should not yet execute the command, and should write some fancy bit to the prompt instead

** Also make it programmable! i.e. complete git branches etc. Maybe have auto complete let you supply a regex
_example_
if (/git checkout -b/.test()) {
    // perform git branch command
    // auto complete git branch
}
